Project Euler Problem 58

    Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
    spiral with side length 7 is formed.

        37 36 35 34 33 32 31
        38 17 16 15 14 13 30
        39 18  5  4  3 12 29
        40 19  6  1  2 11 28
        41 20  7  8  9 10 27
        42 21 22 23 24 25 26
        43 44 45 46 47 48 49

    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
    diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
    lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.

    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
    spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
    what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes
    along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

        public string Answer {
            get {
                return "The side length of the square spiral is {0}"
                    .FormatWith(this.Solve());

        public double Solve() {
            int sl = 3;  // side lenght
            int dc = 5;  // diagonal count
            int pc = 0;  // prime count

            while (true) {
                int l = sl - 1;  // limit

                for (int c = sl * sl, i = 0; i < 4; i++, c -= l) {
                    if (c.IsPrime()) {
                        pc++;
                    }
                }

                sl += 2;
                dc += 4;

                if (dc > 10 * pc) {
                    break;
                }
            }

            return sl;
        }
    }
